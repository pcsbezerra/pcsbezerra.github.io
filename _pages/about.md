About me
======
Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy and Department of Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I am also an affiliated researcher with the Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project lab. I specialize in International Relations and Political Methodology. I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and my B.A. in Political Science from Haverford College.
