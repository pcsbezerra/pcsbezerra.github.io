About me
======
Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy and Department of Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Accounting from the University of Brasília (UnB, Brazil) in July 2013, a Master of Science in Finance and Quantitative Methods from UnB in April 2016, and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from UnB in May 2021.
